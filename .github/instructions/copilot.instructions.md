Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

- No documentation
- No test cases, unless you need them to verify a new code logic
- We have not yet launched, so no need to consider backward compatibility, or migration from old versions.
- We do not need examples, documentation and README files. So do not generate them.
